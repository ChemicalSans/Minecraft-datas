## How to extract basic files
1. Download server.jar of the desired version (from [official site]([https://www.minecraft.net/](https://www.minecraft.net/)) to avoid malware)
2. Open a bash or command prompt in the directory where server.jar is located
3. run `java -cp server.jar net.minecraft.data.Main --all` (make sure you have Java installed)
  
This will generate the "basic" files (= rectangles in the diagrams below). 
"Special" files (= rectangles with rounded corners in the diagrams below) are generated by a personal program.

<i>server.jar downloads can be found here : [version_manifest.json](https://launchermeta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest.json)</i>
